## Question:

In a Databricks environment, dropping a table removes all the underlying data files from storage for which type of table?

## Answers:

### Correct answers:

#### Answer 1:

Managed tables

### Incorrect answers:

#### Answer 1:

External tables

## Explanation:

External tables are no managed by Databricks. Altough their metadata is on Databricks, the actual data is not, so dropping an external table will not delete the underlying data files.
