## Answers:

### Correct answers:

#### Answer 1:

df.withWatermark("event_time", "10 minutes")
```

### Incorrect answers:

#### Answer 1:

```python
df.filter(col("event_time") > current_timestamp() - expr("INTERVAL 10 MINUTES"))
```

#### Answer 2:

```python
df.groupBy("event_time").count()
```

## Explanation:

Watermarking ensures that late data beyond the specified delay threshold (10 minutes here) is ignored during processing.
