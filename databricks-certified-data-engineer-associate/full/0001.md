## Question:

Today is January 15th, 2025. You are working with a Delta Lake table named `sales_data`. A new data engineer joined your team and accidentally modified the table. You want to view the table as it existed two days ago to verify the changes.

Which SQL query allows you to accomplish this?

## Answers:

### Correct answers:

#### Answer 1:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_data TIMESTAMP AS OF '2025-01-15';
```

### Incorrect answers:

#### Answer 1:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_data VERSION AS OF 2;
```

#### Answer 2:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_data WHERE _version = '2025-01-15';
```

#### Answer 3:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_data WHERE _timestamp = '2025-01-15';
```

## Explanation:

Delta Lake supports time travel using the `VERSION AS OF` or `TIMESTAMP AS OF` clauses. In this case, `TIMESTAMP AS OF` is used with the date format.
