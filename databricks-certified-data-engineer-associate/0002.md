## Question:

A Delta Lake table has 1,000 small Parquet files due to frequent small batch writes. You decide to optimize the table for better performance.

Which of the following commands should you run?

## Answers:

OPTIMIZE delta_table;
```

```sql
REPAIR TABLE delta_table;
```

#### Answer 2:

```sql
VACUUM delta_table;
```

#### Answer 3:

The `OPTIMIZE` command merges small Parquet files into larger ones for better query performance. Other options like `VACUUM` and `REPAIR` are not relevant for compaction.
